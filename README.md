## About Program??

This program is more like a backend email validation process. Takes in a email, sends an OTP and validates it :) . Made by a self taught student, so you can't expect professionally neat code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src` : folder contains Main App.java
- `lib` : folder contains dependencies and support java classes

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Contribution?

If you find some sort of bug or think that code can be written much neater, a suggestion is always welcome!! Im a self taught student, so I like every type of external knowledge :)
