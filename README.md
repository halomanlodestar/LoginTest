## About Program??

This program is more like a backend email validation process. Takes in a email, sends an OTP and validates it :) . Made by a self taught student, so you can't expect professionally neat code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: folder contains Main App.java
- `lib`: folder contains dependencies and support java classes

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Contribution?

If you find some sort of bug or think that code can be written much neater, a suggestion is always welcome!! Im a self taught student, so I like every type of external knowledge :)

## Update 

> 1. Added the 'Sign Up' feature.
> 2. Added a base Screen with two key options, Login & Sign Up
> 3. Login and SignUp screens are now fully functional. If there is an existing user in data base `ie : src/userDB.txt` then it will log you in.
> 4. Logging in no longer updates Data Base.
> 5. Now only Signing Up Updates Data Base.
> 6. Seprated Frames and now login and Sign up frames extend frame.java class
> 7. Login and Sign Up screens now show errors in the GUI screen.

## Known Issues

If Data Base is empty, data base writing won't work and so won't logging in. Although you can still sign up.
Password is set to visible, couldn't yet find out an alternate method _/shrug_
