## About Program??

This program is more like a backend email validation process. Takes in a email, sends an OTP and validates it :) . Made by a self taught student, so you can't expect professionally neat code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src` : folder contains Main App.java
- `lib` : folder contains dependencies and support java classes

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Contribution?

If you find some sort of bug or think that code can be written much neater, a suggestion is always welcome!! Im a self taught student, so I like every type of external knowledge :)

## Update 22-07-2022

**NOTE** : I did re-write everything from scratch for the sake of asthetics..

1. Removed all Jframes except Base frame.
2. Merged everything into one frame in the form of JLayeredPanes..
    Pros :
        -> Takes much less memory 
        -> Wraps things up
3. Removed OTPvalidation service because didn't get motivation to work on it.

## Known Issues

`1.` Backend is frozen.
`2.` Multiple main methods (for testing)

`2. ` Hadn't updated since last decade.


> Coded in VScode
